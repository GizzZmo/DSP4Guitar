DSP effects for guitar - compendium

**Chapter 1: Gain, Distortion, Overdrive & Fuzz**. 
First, I'll expand the technical explanations behind non-linear waveshaping and clipping techniques, then provide structured C++ implementations, followed by optimization strategies and effect variations.

### **Step 1: Deepening the DSP Theory for Distortion Effects**  

#### **1.1 Understanding Non-Linear Waveshaping**  
Distortion and overdrive effects fundamentally work by altering the waveform **non-linearly**. This means the output is not a simple scaled version of the input. Instead, harmonic content is introduced by **clipping**, where the peaks of the waveform are flattened or shaped differently.

- **Hard Clipping:** The simplest form—any signal exceeding a threshold is limited to a maximum value, creating sharp edges in the waveform.
- **Soft Clipping:** Instead of abrupt limiting, a mathematical function is used to gently round off peaks, producing a warmer, smoother distortion.
- **Asymmetrical Clipping:** Some circuits clip the positive and negative halves differently, affecting the harmonic profile.
- **Waveshaping Functions:** Functions like **tanh**, **atan**, and cubic polynomials create different timbres.

#### **1.2 Mathematical Models for Clipping**  
Here are some common clipping formulas used in guitar effects:

- **Hard Clipping (Simple Thresholding)**  
  \[
  y(n) = \max(-T, \min(T, x(n) * G))
  \]
  where \( T \) is the clipping threshold and \( G \) is the gain.

- **Soft Clipping (Hyperbolic Tangent)**  
  \[
  y(n) = \tanh(G \cdot x(n))
  \]
  Creates a more natural-sounding saturation.

- **Asymmetrical Clipping (Different curves for positive/negative)**  
  \[
  y(n) = 
  \begin{cases} 
    \tanh(G \cdot x(n)) & x(n) > 0 \\
    \text{atan}(G \cdot x(n)) & x(n) < 0
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Adds odd harmonics, often found in tube amps.

### **Step 2: Structured C++ Implementation**  

#### **2.1 Basic Gain & Hard Clipping**
Here’s a basic implementation of a distortion effect in C++:

```cpp
class Distortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gain, float threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            float sample = buffer[i] * gain;
            buffer[i] = std::max(-threshold, std::min(threshold, sample));
        }
    }
};
```
This applies **hard clipping** to an input buffer.

#### **2.2 Soft Clipping with `tanh()`**
```cpp
#include <cmath>

class SoftClipDistortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gain) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            buffer[i] = std::tanh(gain * buffer[i]);
        }
    }
};
```
This creates **tube-like saturation**.

---

### **Step 3: Optimization Strategies**  

#### **3.1 Avoiding Expensive Computations**
- **Lookup Tables:** Instead of recalculating `tanh` every sample, precompute values and store them in an array.
- **Piecewise Approximations:** Instead of using trigonometric functions, use polynomials for similar effects with less CPU load.
- **Parameter Smoothing:** Avoid abrupt gain changes to prevent artifacts.

#### **3.2 Efficient Buffer Processing**
- **SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data):** Use vectorized operations for real-time efficiency.
- **Circular Buffers for Delay Effects:** Many distortion effects incorporate feedback or dynamic shaping.

---

### **Step 4: Creative Effect Variations**
- **Dynamic Distortion:** Link gain to envelope followers for **auto-adaptive overdrive**.
- **Multi-Band Distortion:** Split signal into frequency bands, applying different clipping curves.
- **Octave-Up Fuzz:** Introduce rectification (absolute value function) before distortion for octave doubling.

---

Let's refine the C++ implementations for clarity, efficiency, and real-time performance. The goal is to ensure **smooth parameter transitions**, avoid **expensive computations**, and keep the **DSP processing streamlined** for low-latency operation.

---

### **Optimized C++ Implementations for Distortion Effects**

#### **1. Hard Clipping with Efficient Buffer Processing**
We'll optimize the hard clipping function using **SIMD operations** and avoid branching where possible.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>  // For std::clamp

class HardClipDistortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gain, float threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            buffer[i] = std::clamp(buffer[i] * gain, -threshold, threshold);
        }
    }
};
```
- **Improvement:** `std::clamp()` ensures the clipping is optimized without explicit branching (`if` statements), improving processor efficiency.

---

#### **2. Soft Clipping with Fast Approximation**
Hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) is computationally expensive. Instead, let's **approximate** it using a **third-order polynomial**, which provides a smooth non-linearity while avoiding slow transcendental functions.

```cpp
#include <cmath>

class SoftClipDistortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gain) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            float x = buffer[i] * gain;
            buffer[i] = x * (27 + x * x) / (27 + 9 * x * x); // Approximate tanh
        }
    }
};
```
- **Improvement:** Replaces `std::tanh()` with a **rational polynomial** approximation, significantly reducing CPU cost while preserving a similar saturation curve.

---

#### **3. Asymmetrical Clipping for Tube-Like Harmonics**
Here’s a **split processing approach**, where positive and negative halves of the waveform are clipped **differently**.

```cpp
#include <cmath>

class AsymmetricalClipDistortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gain) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            float sample = buffer[i] * gain;
            buffer[i] = (sample > 0) ? std::tanh(sample) : std::atan(sample);
        }
    }
};
```
- **Improvement:** Uses **`tanh` for the positive** part and **`atan` for the negative**, mimicking the asymmetric response of analog tube circuits.

---

#### **4. Parameter Smoothing for Real-Time Adjustments**
If a parameter (e.g., gain) changes abruptly, it causes **audible clicks** or **zipper noise**. Let's smooth parameter changes using a simple **exponential decay filter**.

```cpp
class SmoothParameter {
public:
    SmoothParameter(float smoothingFactor) : alpha(smoothingFactor), smoothedValue(0.0f) {}

    float smooth(float targetValue) {
        smoothedValue = alpha * targetValue + (1.0f - alpha) * smoothedValue;
        return smoothedValue;
    }

private:
    float alpha;  // Smoothing factor (0.001 - 0.1 for gradual changes)
    float smoothedValue;
};
```

Usage within **distortion processing**:

```cpp
class DistortionWithSmoothing {
    SmoothParameter gainSmoother{0.01f}; // Example smoothing factor

public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float targetGain) {
        float gain = gainSmoother.smooth(targetGain);
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            buffer[i] = std::tanh(gain * buffer[i]);
        }
    }
};
```
- **Improvement:** **Smooths changes** in gain over time, preventing sudden volume jumps.

---

### **Optimization Strategies**
- **Lookup Tables** for nonlinear functions (`tanh`, `sin`).
- **SIMD Processing** (`std::valarray` or AVX/FMA intrinsics for batch processing).
- **Avoid Branching** (`std::clamp` instead of `if` conditions).
- **Efficient Memory Management** (avoid dynamic allocation in real-time DSP loops).

---

This refined code ensures real-time **efficiency**, **smooth parameter handling**, and **high-quality distortion tones**. Would you like further improvements, such as **multi-band distortion, dynamic overdrive**, or additional **effect variations**?

Fantastic! Let’s dive into **multi-band distortion**, **dynamic overdrive**, and additional **effect variations** to expand your toolkit for guitar DSP.

### **1. Multi-Band Distortion: Frequency-Split Processing**
Instead of applying **distortion to the entire signal**, we split it into frequency bands (like **bass, mids, treble**) and process them **independently** before mixing them back. This allows finer control over tone shaping.

#### **1.1 Concept Breakdown**
- Use **band-pass filters** to separate **low, mid, and high** frequency regions.
- Apply **different distortion curves** for each band.
- Mix the processed signals back together.

#### **1.2 C++ Implementation**
Here’s an example of **3-band distortion processing**:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

class MultiBandDistortion {
public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float gainLow, float gainMid, float gainHigh) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            float lowFreq = lowPass(buffer[i]);  // Extract bass
            float midFreq = bandPass(buffer[i]); // Extract mids
            float highFreq = highPass(buffer[i]); // Extract treble
            
            // Apply different distortions
            lowFreq = std::tanh(gainLow * lowFreq);  // Soft distortion for lows
            midFreq = std::tanh(gainMid * midFreq);  // Medium drive for mids
            highFreq = std::tanh(gainHigh * highFreq); // Hard clipping for highs
            
            // Mix back
            buffer[i] = lowFreq + midFreq + highFreq;
        }
    }

private:
    float lowPass(float sample) { return sample * 0.5f; } // Placeholder for actual filtering
    float bandPass(float sample) { return sample * 0.8f; } // Placeholder for actual filtering
    float highPass(float sample) { return sample * 1.2f; } // Placeholder for actual filtering
};
```

- **Benefit:** Provides **rich tonal shaping**—for example, **warm bass**, **crisp mids**, and **aggressive treble**.

---

### **2. Dynamic Overdrive: Envelope-Controlled Gain**
Instead of **static distortion**, we **dynamically change gain based on the signal’s amplitude**. This mimics **analog tube amplifiers**, where distortion increases when played harder.

#### **2.1 Concept Breakdown**
- Use an **envelope follower** to track **signal strength**.
- Modulate **gain** based on the envelope, creating an **expressive effect**.

#### **2.2 C++ Implementation**
```cpp
class DynamicOverdrive {
    float envelope = 0.0f; // Smoothly tracks signal energy

public:
    void process(float* buffer, int numSamples, float baseGain, float sensitivity) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
            float input = std::abs(buffer[i]); // Track signal level
            envelope = (envelope * 0.99f) + (input * 0.01f); // Smooth envelope
            
            float dynamicGain = baseGain + (sensitivity * envelope); // Modulate gain
            
            buffer[i] = std::tanh(dynamicGain * buffer[i]); // Apply overdrive
        }
    }
};
```

- **Benefit:** **Expressive distortion**, adjusting dynamically **based on playing intensity**.

---

### **3. Additional Effect Variations**
#### **3.1 Octave-Up Fuzz (Rectified Distortion)**
- **Idea:** Process the **absolute value** of the waveform, shifting harmonic content **up one octave** before applying fuzz.
- **Implementation:**  
  ```cpp
  buffer[i] = std::tanh(std::abs(buffer[i]) * gain);
  ```
- **Sound:** Adds **aggressive high-end harmonics**.

#### **3.2 Bitcrusher (Lo-Fi Distortion)**
- **Idea:** Reduce **bit-depth and sample rate** for a **gritty digital sound**.
- **Implementation:**  
  ```cpp
  buffer[i] = round(buffer[i] * quantizationLevels) / quantizationLevels;
  ```
- **Sound:** Adds **chiptune-like distortion** or **retro fuzz**.

#### **3.3 Tube Emulation (Dynamic Saturation)**
- **Idea:** Use **non-linear waveshaping + dynamic gain smoothing** for **tube-like warmth**.
- **Implementation:**  
  ```cpp
  float warmFactor = 1.0f - exp(-std::abs(buffer[i])); // Mimic tube saturation
  buffer[i] = warmFactor * std::tanh(buffer[i]);
  ```
- **Sound:** Mimics **analog amp saturation**.
